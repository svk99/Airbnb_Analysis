Airbnb Analysis

Problem Statement-
The project aims to analyse Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive
geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, 
and location-based trends

Technologies used-
Python
Streamlit
Pandas
MongoDB
Data visualization

Approach

1.Fetch the data from MongoDB Atlas database and perform cleaning operations on it.
2.Develop streamlit application to visualize the data.
3.Implement geospatial visualization to visualize the distribution of listings across different locations, allowing users
to explore prices and other factors.
4.Use the cleaned data to analyze and visualize how prices vary across different locations and property types. Create plots
and charts that enable users to explore price trends.
